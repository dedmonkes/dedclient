        <h3>Ded Monkes Derug Part I: Origins</h3>
        <p>Back to the Beginning
It all started in late November, 2021. Around this time, lots of projects were launching with the “low supply & low mint price” tactic following in the footsteps of Boryoku Dragonz. Some were lazy cash crabs trying to build off the success of the Dragonz, while some grew into real projects. Mutated Monkes launched with the same tactic, and I am sure you can tell which type of project it turned into. </p>

<p>On November 20th, Mutated Monkes launched with a supply of 666, and a mint price of 0.16 SOL. They didn’t had a discord at the time of launch, just a twitter account. Hype behind the project began to build quickly and the mint sold out in 18 minutes. After that a discord was lanched and a community was formed.
The founder of this project self-identified himself as « Head Monke ». Head Monke promised us he would come out with a roadmap within 24 hours of the mint closing. Sure enough, he did… kinda. Roadmap was: “OHM Fork (more details to come)”. Despite the lack of a structured roadmap, an OHM Fork was all the community needed to get excited about the project. The floor began flying and peaked at 6 SOL with 
multiple 30+ SOL sales. The hype continued to build as Head Monke promised our own coin as well as an upcoming website with details on the OHM Fork. 
</p>

<p>Well, it turns out that when the website launched on Nov. 30th, with a secret new stealth mint called « Monke Domes ». These were basically NFT’s with only a floating Mutated Monke head as the art. They launched with a supply of 111, and a mint price of 1 SOL. This secret launch upset the community as some weren’t 
    able to mint while others plainly called it a cash grab. Head Monke promised that the Monke Domes would have some amazing utility within the OHM Fork and that everything would be worth it in the ends. This was enough to put the community’s nerves at ease as we patiently waited for the next step of the project. </p>
<p>On December 4th Head Monke said he had some great news in store for us. Sure enough, he did as he made a double announcement. The first one outlined the Monke Dome utility which was as follows: « Monke Domes will receive 2x the amount of tokens a Mutated Monke receives, however YOU must have it paired with a Mutated Monke to receive airdrops. 
<ul className='mx-1 my-1 text-info'>
<li>Mutated Monke by itself - Normal Airdrop</li>
<li>Mutated Monke + Monke Dome - 3x Mutated Monke airdrop.</li>
<li>Monke Dome by itself - nothing</li>
<li>(1 Monke Dome per Mutated Monke) »</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The second announcement was the official launch of our own token called $MUTANT. This coin was supposed to be the one used for the upcoming OHM Fork staking, so the community bought a ton of it in anticipation. Head Monke even shilled it four times within 72 hours of the launch on the Mutated Monkes twitter.  Realistically, the only next step was to wait for the OHM Fork to be delivered.
The community was patiently waiting for this life-changing OHM fork, but wanted to get updated on its progress along the way. Well, in order to keep the community updated on the progress, Head Monke wrote a “whitepaper” on Dec 9th which can still be found here: https://mutated-monke.gitbook.io/mutant/.
If you go to that link, you will clearly see it is by no stretch of the imagination, a whitepaper. This worried the community as he took over 72 hours to write what appeared as copy/paste from previous announcements he made in the Discord server. The only explanation he gave was that he would update the whitepaper daily. Four days passed and we didn’t see any of those. 

</p>
<p>
In response to the community’s outrage, he put out a message which will go down in history: « All I can say is Wednesday/Thursday is going to be a big day for us all! » (Wed=Dec 15th, Thurs = Dec 16th)
Despite the community confusion, we rallied behind the thought of a final big upcoming announcement in the near future. We began to patiently wait for this news but on Tuesday, Dec 14th a massive sell order was placed on the $MUTANT liquidity pool which drained roughly $18,000 USDC. This completely tanked the price of our $MUTANT coin and rendered our $MUTANT investments practically worthless. The community was shocked and panicked as we didn’t know what had happened. 
We patiently awaited a reply from Head Monke about how to proceed from here. 


</p>

<p>
After 24 hours of silence, reality set in that he wasn’t returning. We traced where the giant 18,000 USDC sell order came from and it turned out it came from the same account that was getting the royalties from Mutated Monkes sales.  It was at this moment that we knew we had been rugged… twice. Our NFT collection no longer had a founder, we understood that there hadn’t ever been any devs working on an OHM Fork and our coin was now worth nothing. Luckily, that isn’t where the story ends.</p>
 
<h3>Ded Monkes Derug Part II: Reviving from the Ded</h3>
<p>
Although we were still pretty p****** about the whole situation a few of the former mods, in particular Kumo and Devour, took it upon themselves to get the project back on track by trying to derug it. Within 48H from the mega-sell-off Devour created a new Discord server for all Mutated Monkes to take refuge. 
(I actually don’t know how Professor Mint/NaughtygGrimace/Cryptowavy/Hotrod joined, so that part needs to be added in the above text)
Once word got out in the ‘old’ Mutated Monke server we were going to try to derug the collection and had created a new Discord server people started to join. Right from the start it was clear that everybody was there for the same reason: turning something negative into something positive and doing so with community and integrity in mind. That mindset created the foundation for what we feel is the most supportive and strongest community we’ve ever been a part of.

How @ProfessorMint and @Cryptowavy joined as lead devs
How we gathered and united the community around this new team to foster the start of this brand new derugging adventure
</p>
<p>
Creating the new Discord was a monumental first step to even have a chance to create a ‘new’ Ded Monke community (the name of course was voted upon a little while later). Because what is a derug worth if not for it’s community backing it. It gave everybody a chance to pitch in and vent some of the disappointment about the MM rug.
