    <h3>Our Origins</h3>
<p>It all started on November 20th when the Mutated Monkes launched with a supply of 666, and a mint price of 0.16 SOL. Hype behind the project began to build quickly and the mint sold out in 18 minutes. After that a discord was launched and a community was formed.</p>
<p>The founder of this project self-identified himself as “Head Monke“. After 24 hours, Head Monke released his roadmap which promised us an OHM Fork. Despite the lack of a structured roadmap, an OHM Fork was all the community needed to get excited about the project. The hype continued to build as Head Monke promised our own coin as well as an upcoming website with details on the OHM Fork. Well, it turns out that when the website launched on Nov. 30th, there was a secret stealth mint included on the site called “Monke Domes” (now known as Ded Heads)  On December 4th Head Monke announced the official launch of our own token called $MUTANT. This coin was supposed to be the one used for the upcoming OHM Fork staking, so the community bought a ton of it in anticipation. </p>
<p>Well just 10 days later, a massive sell order was placed on the $MUTANT liquidity pool which drained roughly $18,000 USDC. Head Monke had officially drained the coin of all funds and took his royalty funds (approx. 400 SOL) and ran. Luckily, that isn’t where the story ends.</p>

<h3>The Ded Monkes</h3>
<p>Our mission here for the Ded Monkes is simple: to build and reward the best community of 666 monkes and their fellow 111 Ded Heads.</p>

<p>The Ded Monkes were created after already being rugged, so we know what its like to be ded and revived. We were founded on the principles of respect, friendship and helping out fellow monkes. Welcome to the most social community on Solana... the Ded Monkes.</p>
